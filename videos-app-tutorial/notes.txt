                    CONTEXT WITH REDUCER
Refactoring the entire code with Context api

                    Custom hooks
Hooks can only be called inside a functional component.

                    
                        USEREF HOOK
Every time a state variable changes and a component re-renders, variables declared with let and const are also
reinitialized!!
What if we want to make a variable which doesn't cause re-renders, but maintains it values across re-renders?
useRef âœ¨

useRef returns an object. So to use value of numOfClicks, we need to use numOfClicks.current.
useRef helps us select DOM elements, something which we can't do using normal React. To link a ref to a DOM element, 
pass the variable in the ref attribute of the HTML element.

REFER TO THE REACT DOCS, THEY ARE AMAZING

React is used for single-page applications. Pages don't reload after every action. You can use React in multi-page 
applications as well.
React is a UI library based on components.

With traditional HTML & JS, it's very difficult to manage apps if we have a lot of complicated contents.
Each web page can be broken into components (parts). YouTube has video lists, each video list has a video, each
video has a thumbnail, title.

A DOM tree can be very vast, but a component tree has 
1> Easy structure
2> Reusability

To write javascript expressions in JSX, use {}

-> Inline styles must be passed as an object
props ✅

-> props are read-only. Don't reassign them through onClick etc
-> When you nest a component inside another component, access the inner component using props.children or {children}

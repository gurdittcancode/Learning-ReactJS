REFER TO THE REACT DOCS, THEY ARE AMAZING

React is used for single-page applications. Pages don't reload after every action. You can use React in multi-page 
applications as well.
React is a UI library based on components.

With traditional HTML & JS, it's very difficult to manage apps if we have a lot of complicated contents.
Each web page can be broken into components (parts). YouTube has video lists, each video list has a video, each
video has a thumbnail, title.

A DOM tree can be very vast, but a component tree has 
1> Easy structure
2> Reusability

To write javascript expressions in JSX, use {}

-> Inline styles must be passed as an object
props ✅

-> props are read-only. Don't reassign them through onClick etc
-> If you want to pass another oject as props to a component, you can use the spread operator to do that.
-> When you nest a component inside another component, access the inner component using props.children or {children}

How to conditionally render stuff and how to render lists in React?
Conditionally adding check mark if a channel is verified 
1. Use if-else block - but there are simpler methods
2. Use ternary operator
3. (BEST) use logical AND short-circuiting

Rendering videos using a list, by creating a videos array. Adding an id attribute to videos to generate different thumbnails.

* Each list child should have a unique key prop. So that React vDOM can uniquely target a child and only re-render it if 
it has been changed. Your database generates an ID, if front-end only project, use uuid() to generate.

Creating a thumbnail component.
Adding different functionality to the buttons. One will log, the other will alert

Across React components, we have event bubbling. If we click on a playbutton, the onClick of App is also getting triggered.
So, in the onClick function of button, do event.stopPropagation()

useState

If you change a variable normally and want to see the changes, you must re-render the components. How?
Make that variable a state variable. useState is a hook -> an external function which we are using. State is a temporary
memory in React. The state is getting stored globally somewhere, and the hook is referring to that.

* You don't directly change a state variable.
